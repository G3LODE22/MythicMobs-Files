MythicMobs-Files
===============

A collection of config files I use with the MythicMobs plugin on my server. These files are provided as-is, with no warranty whatsoever. I frequently use the latest bleeding-edge builds of MythicMobs, and if you intend to use any of these files, I encourage you to do the same. [You can get premium access here after signing up for the MythicMobs forums.](https://www.mythicmobs.net/index.php?account/upgrades)

If you appreciate me maintaining this repo, please consider [backing me on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/summacrossroads) These files are designed for the Summa Crossroads Minecraft server, and if I'm unable to keep running it, I will stop maintaining the files and developing new ones.
